# Change Log

Meant to mirror the current supported game release for its major and minor version number, and room for conveying a patch to the extension itself. I believe it's best to communicate compatible game versions first, over anything about the extension itself, given its purpose to help with a DSL.

## [24.3.0]

- Adjusted based color in syntax highlighting.
- Parity to latest MGD functions.

## [24.0.0]

- Parity with v24 functions for autocomplete.
- Gridmap templates when making a scene in EventText.
- When making an event, EventText is now empty and is the last placeholder location that is tabbed to. This lets the autocomplete better integrate with a blank scene or gridmap scene autocomplete.
- Added possibly unnecessary check to see if at least one scene exists in EventText due to previous change.
- More consistent sub-function labeling and descriptions.
- Fixed IfPlayerDoesntHaveStatusEffect functions having a space in their strings.

## [23.9.1]

- Reduce requirements.

## [23.9.0]

- Initial release
