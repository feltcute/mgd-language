# Change Log

Meant to mirror the current supported game release for its major and minor version number, and room for conveying a patch to the extension itself. I believe it is best to communicate compatible game versions first, over anything about the extension itself, given its purpose to help with a DSL.

## [23.9.0]

- Initial release
